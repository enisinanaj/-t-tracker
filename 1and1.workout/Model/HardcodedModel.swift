        "Lie supine on bench or mat. Place hands under lower buttock on each side to support pelvis. Keeping knees straight, raise legs by flexing hips until hips are completely flexed. Return until hips and knees are extended. Repeat.",
        "Stand with feet hip-width apart. Lift and bend a knee, gently pulling it close to your body. Return and repeat while alternating legs.",
        "Lie prone on floor with hands slightly wider than shoulder width. Raise body up off floor by extending arms with body straight. Keeping body straight, lower body to floor by bending arms. Push body up until arms are extended. Repeat.",
        "Lift lead knee high and step forward while swinging opposite arm up. Begin lifting second leg and its opposite arm before planting lead foot. Continue movement on opposite side, alternating quickly between sides."
